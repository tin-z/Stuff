## details
 
While doing variant analysis between libreoffice and openoffice codebases, i
found a poc on twitter for a CVE of libreoffice which turned out to be a oday
on openoffice (thank you friend for the free cve). And so i reported the
vulnerability and after inspecting the patch i concluded that, while
libreoffice and openoffice codebases are similar, the uri schema part was different.
